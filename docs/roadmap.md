# Roadmap

Where the project stands. This file holds **position only** — status, spec links, current focus. What each epic contains and how it is judged complete lives in `docs/05-mvp-plan.md`; nothing from there is repeated here.

This is the roadmap's single home, whatever the tracker (`ADR-0025`).

**Status vocabulary:** `not started` → `spec` (being specified) → `tickets` (sliced, not yet built) → `in progress` → `done`.

## v1

| # | Epic | Status | Spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Core and persistence | done | [`core-and-persistence`](specs/core-and-persistence/spec.md) |
| 2 | MCP and Product Snapshot | done | [`mcp-and-product-snapshot`](specs/mcp-and-product-snapshot/spec.md) |
| 3 | Tracker and Matt Pocock integration | done | [`tracker-and-matt-pocock-integration`](specs/tracker-and-matt-pocock-integration/spec.md) |
| 4 | Telemetry | done | [`telemetry`](specs/telemetry/spec.md) |
| 5 | Minimal dashboard | done | [`minimal-dashboard`](specs/minimal-dashboard/spec.md) |
| 6 | Dashboard design and languages | not started | — |
| 7 | Audit and adopt | not started | — |

Epics are ordered by dependency, not by preference. Epic 1 is the foundation; epics 5 to 7 are only meaningful once 1 to 4 exist. Audit and adopt is epic 6 in the specs of epics 1 to 3, written before epic 6 was inserted on 2026-09-26.

## Current focus

Design is complete: `docs/08-open-questions.md` is resolved by ADR-0001 to ADR-0018; building the epics added ADR-0019 to ADR-0033.

Epics 1 to 5 are done: the daemon and its store (epic 1); the snapshot, daily and checkpoint over MCP, and the `binnacle` plugin with autopilot (epic 2); Tasks from GitHub, GitLab or local tickets, and `binn init` (epic 3); usage by model, Task and role (epic 4); the read-only dashboard, `binn dashboard` (epic 5). Binnacle writes nothing into the repository.

Epic 6, Dashboard design and languages, was grilled on 2026-09-26 from the owner's findings on epic 5's dashboard (ticket 09's *Comments*): a "What's next" block that leads with the Next action and offers Binnacle's alternatives beside it, English and Russian, Paperclip's shell, Nuxt UI (ADR-0033). Its decisions and the prompt for the designer are in `specs/dashboard-design-and-languages/design-brief.md`. The owner gives that prompt to an AI design tool and saves the mockup in `design/` beside the brief.

Next action: once the mockup is saved beside the brief, specify epic 6 from both. `/mattpocock-skills:to-spec`

## Later

Deferred deliberately, each with the decision that deferred it:

- installing `binnd` as an auto-starting service per platform — `ADR-0016`;
- standalone binaries for users without Node — `ADR-0016`;
- adopting a large third-party repository as a baseline case — `docs/00-scope.md`;
- autopilot notifications through a Telegram bot, beside the push notification it sends today — `ADR-0022`;
- CI state in the Product Snapshot, which stays marked unavailable — this repository has no CI to build it against;
- OpenTelemetry as a live telemetry path, and support level 4 — `ADR-0011`, `specs/telemetry/spec.md`;
- cost computed from a price table — `specs/telemetry/spec.md`: a subscription makes such a number conditional;
- context pressure and its attention item — `docs/04-telemetry-dashboard.md`, deferred by `specs/telemetry/spec.md`;
- CLI commands mirroring the MCP tools, for harnesses that have a shell but no MCP — `ADR-0014`, when such a user appears;
- changing a local ticket's `Status:` from the dashboard — a separate ADR narrowing `ADR-0020`, only if working with the read-only dashboard shows it is needed;
- forking the Matt Pocock skills into the `binnacle` plugin — only if a skill's procedure, not just its conventions in `docs/agents/`, has to change;
- publishing `@binnacle/cli` to npm, with the build step that turns its TypeScript into JavaScript and the dashboard generated into it (`ADR-0031`): Node does not strip types under `node_modules`, so until then `binn` runs from the linked workspace — `specs/tracker-and-matt-pocock-integration/spec.md`, *Out of Scope*;
- reading a record's branch again when its checkout's reflog can still give one: a record stored with the harness's branch before ADR-0029's order, or whose reflog lookup failed or timed out — `ADR-0030`, only if it matters in practice;
- autopilot resuming by itself once a usage limit resets: on 2026-09-25 a Product session did it by hand, with a script that waited for the reset and a message to the autopilot session — `ADR-0022`, when limits interrupt runs often;
- fewer rebases in a parallel autopilot run: every ticket's last commit rewrites the same current-focus paragraph, so the second of two parallel branches always rebased (five of eight merges on 2026-09-26) — `ADR-0022`, if rebasing slows runs;
- deeper Graphify integration, Obsidian export automation, worktree parallelism recommendations, further harness adapters — `docs/05-mvp-plan.md`, phase 7, and only after real measurement.

Items excluded from the product altogether are not listed here. See the non-goals in `docs/00-scope.md`.

## Keeping this current

Update the status column when an epic changes state. An epic moves to `spec` in the change that fills its spec link, when `to-spec` produces the spec: a `spec` row whose Spec cell is `—` is reported as `roadmap.spec_missing`. A stale roadmap is worse than none, because Product Snapshot reads its position from here.

The epic table's header and the `## Current focus` heading are a contract with Binnacle (`specs/mcp-and-product-snapshot/spec.md`). Change them and the snapshot reports a diagnostic instead of a position. Each row's `#` must be a number, its Status one of the vocabulary above, written exactly, and its Spec cell `—` or a link to `specs/<slug>/spec.md`; a row that is not is left out of the snapshot, with a diagnostic. The current focus reaches a fresh session only up to its first 2000 characters, so keep it short.

The current focus ends with a paragraph that starts with `Next action:` and ends with exactly one command in backticks, the one the owner types to take it, such as `/binnacle:autopilot` or `/mattpocock-skills:implement <ticket path>`, so that the next step can be copied rather than worked out (the owner, 2026-09-26). Epic 5's dashboard reads that command as the Next action and shows Binnacle's Suggested step beside it (ADR-0032). A focus that ends otherwise, or whose command names a Task already done, is an attention item there.
